# Enriching Statistical Inferences on Brain Connectivity for Alzheimer's Disease Analysis via Latent Space Graph Embedding
The objective is to identify regions of interests (ROIs) in the brain that are affected by topological changes of brain connectivity due to specific neurodegenerative diseases by enriching statistical group analysis. We tackle this problem by learning a latent space where statistical inference can be made more effectively.
